README for "more"
Sal Valente <svalente@mit.edu> 1995-11-29

This is the "more" pager from BSD 4.3.
According to the the source file, it was SCCS version 5.19, originally
written in 1980, last modified at Berkely in 1988.
This particular version has been available on Linux ftp sites for years,
and probably has been modified many times.

I added the ability to go backwards when reading from a pipe.
